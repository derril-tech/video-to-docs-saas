# PYTHON PRACTICES

- Prefer `pyproject.toml` over requirements when possible; pin minimal, necessary versions.
- Use `ruff` + `black`; add pre-commit hooks when a repo has `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
- Include docstrings for public functions; add type hints for function signatures.
- Avoid global state; prefer dependency injection for clients (LLM, DB, HTTP).
- Write a fast smoke test for core paths (see testing rule).
