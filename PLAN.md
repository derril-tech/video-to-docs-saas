# Plan

## Product Vision
Voice-to-Docs SaaS enables users to dictate anywhere (web/mobile) and automatically generate structured documents with headings, lists, tables, templates, smart fields, and export flows. It integrates with popular tools like Notion, Google Docs, and Jira to streamline capture → doc → workflow.

- Capture audio in real-time or via upload, transcribe accurately, and add punctuation.
- Support structured voice commands to build and format documents.
- Provide templates and slot filling for common document types.
- Enable entity extraction (smart fields) for dates, owners, amounts, etc.
- Collaborate in real-time with co-editing, comments, version history.
- Export to multiple formats and sync with external tools.
- Ensure compliance, security, and high performance with multi-tenant billing.
